This is an assignment for my Beginner class in Redi school..

Create an array with 2 or 3 recipes with key words (name, serving, array of ingredients).

Render your recipes in HTML using JavaScript.

Use an ordered list for the recipes and an unordered list for the ingredients.

Add a button to each recipe, when you click on it, it will hide or reveal the contents of the recipe.

When hovering over the title of the recipe, change the color of the text.

Strike a line through one of the ingredients if the user clicks on it.

Make the font of the name of the recipe bigger when the user hovers over it.

modify your recipes array, add a new property to each recipe which contains the image of that recipe, add an img element to your recipe.

make sure the new image is also hidden when the user clicks on the hide button, also bigger when the user clicks on it.
